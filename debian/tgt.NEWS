tgt (1:1.0.46-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  As of 1.0.46-1, tgt in Debian supports using Ceph RBD and GlusterFS volumes
  as backing store. The support is provided by tgt-rbd and tgt-glusterfs
  respectively.

  Also note that as of 1.0.19, upstream has dropped (the experimental) FCoE
  target support from tgt.
